        I often find myself afraid to do anything for fear of being imperfect.
        Both in my professional life as a software engineer and in my personal
        life, I have this desire to be perfect even though I know perfection is
        the enemy of continuous improvement. Being perfect means not making
        mistakes. It means accomplishing something, looking back, and saying,
        "There's no way I could have done that any better." I don't want that
        for myself. That sounds like a lot like complacency. I want to challenge
        myself, make mistakes, and learn from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here's to imperfection, to putting my desire to continuously improve
        into action, and to putting myself out there when it would have been a
        whole lot easier if I just did nothing.
